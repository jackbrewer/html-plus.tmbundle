##Please Note

This bundle is still very much a work in progress. A lot of the final tab triggers have been added but there are no keyboard shortcuts yet.

Feel free to use it but remember to update the bundle - a lot!

##Installation

In Terminal, navigate to the TextMate bundles folder.

	cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/TextMate/Bundles/

If the directory doesn't exist, create it.

Clone the bundle - once you have it, reload your bundles in TextMate and it will appear in the bundles list.

	git clone git://github.com/jackbb/HTML-JackBB.tmbundle.git "HTML-JackBB.tmbundle"

You can easily update the bundle through the TextMate menus by going to *'Bundles > HTML - Jack BB > Update Bundle via Git'*.

### TODO

Add more tags

Add commands for formatting lists etc

Add keyboard shortcuts to everything

Organise the bundle menu structure

Extend the default TextMate HTML language to allow for HTML5 elements *(If you know how to do this, let me know and save me a lot of google hours!)*
