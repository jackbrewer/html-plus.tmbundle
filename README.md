##Please Note

This bundle is still very much a work in progress. A lot of the final tab triggers have been added but there are no keyboard shortcuts yet.

Feel free to use it but remember to update the bundle - a lot!

##Installation

In Terminal, navigate to the TextMate bundles folder.

	cd ~/Library/"Application Support"/TextMate/Bundles/

If the directory doesn't exist, create it.

Clone the bundle - once you have it, reload your bundles in TextMate and it will appear in the bundles list.

	git clone git://github.com/jackbb/HTML-JackBB.tmbundle.git "HTML-JackBB.tmbundle"

You can easily update the bundle through the TextMate menus by going to *'Bundles > HTML - Jack BB > Update Bundle via Git'*.
